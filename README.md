A website designed to assist users in reporting road accidents in a quick and comfortable manner, reducing time wasted. Simply by clicking and filling out a brief form, you may help save more people's lives. This transmits their location and sends the information to the police, fire station, and hospital. Using Google Maps, we can also direct the ambulance to the accident site.
